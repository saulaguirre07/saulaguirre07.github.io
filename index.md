# Hello World

This is my home page! My name Saul Aguirre and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Electrical Engineering.

## Computer Science Projects

### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 Part B was by far my favorite lab because it not only let me play a gambling game I enjoyed, but I was also able to compute many different things, allowing it to operate on its own. It was quite fascinating, getting to test my computing and coding talents within a lab, while making it extremely exciting, as I was running a gambling game. I had to develop routines that made it possible to identify and compute the Blackjack hand.

* Lab 3

    Another one of my favorites was Lab 3 Part 1, where I learned about Basic Metabolic Rate and its implications for humans. It is something new I discovered, as a BMR can be quite important for us humans while attempting to avoid malnutrition and gain/lose weight. Seeing how computing can naturally calculate real-life items when building a function was fascinating and enjoyable.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was another personal favorite lab, simply because it was the easiest, as I was guided through almost every step. It was my first lab for this course, and I was truly extremely excited to begin my computing journey. Although it was really simple, I struggled, but now when I look at it, I cannot believe how easy it is.
